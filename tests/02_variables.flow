# Variables are declared using 'var', followed by the name, type, and value.
var a: int = 10;

print(a); # Expected: 10

# Constants are declared using 'const'. They cannot be reassigned.
const b: int = 20;

print(b); # Expected: 20

# We can reassign variables
a = 30;
print(a); # Expected: 30

# We also support compound assignments
a += 5;
print(a); # Expected: 35

a -= 10;
print(a); # Expected: 25

# We can't reassign constants
# b = 10; # Error
